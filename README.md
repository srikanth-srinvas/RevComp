# RevComp
RevComp is a versatile command-line tool designed to effortlessly reverse complement genetic sequences provided in FASTA format. This tool is particularly useful for researchers and bioinformaticians working with DNA or RNA data, allowing them to quickly generate reverse complement sequences with ease

# Reverse Complement Tool

This tool generates the reverse complement of sequences in a FASTA file.

## Usage

1. Install Biopython:
   ```bash
   pip install biopython

Run the script:

python reverse_complement_tool.py input.fasta output.fasta
Replace input.fasta with the path to your input FASTA file and output.fasta with the desired path for the output file.


Example
python reverse_complement_tool.py input.fasta output.fasta
